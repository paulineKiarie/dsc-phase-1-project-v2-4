# Business problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

# Data understanding

 2. IMDB (https://www.imdb.com/) - im.db

 3. The Numbers (https://www.the-numbers.com/)- tn.movie_budgets.csv

 * From the [first dataset](bom.movie_gross.csv) which is in `.csv` format, we have the title, studios, domestic gross revenue, foreign gross revenue and the year in which the movie was released. We will use data from the studio and domestic gross columns for the analysis .
 
 * From the [second dataset](im.db) which is in `.db` format, we have a database with 8 tables containing different types of non-monetary information about films such as their directors, writers, and genres, and the ratings and [more](images/imdb_data_erd.jpeg). We will use information from movie basics and movie ratings tables

 * From the [third dataset](data/tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz) which is in `.csv` format, we have the names, release dates, production budget, domestic gross revenue and worldwide gross revenue of films that have been released. Here, we use information from the production budget and worldwide gross columns. We calculate correlation of the two and further calculate return on investment using data from the two.

Recommendations
1.Microsoft should consider the type of movies they produce i.e the genres of the movies.From what we have seen that Action ,thriller genre has the top number of votes meaning that most people watch the movies.Microsoft should consider producing the movies that are in the genre that is most popular

2.microsoft should consider producing their movies in the months January and February since we can see that during the months of August, October and December its when most movies are produced. This is going to reduce the compettition since not most movies are released at the beggining of the year

3.Microsoft should consider collaborating with studios such as Buena vista(BV) since it seems to be producing the best movies.This will help the microsoft in production of the most popular movies and will have great retuns

4.While producing the movies, apart from the bud Microsoft should consider factors such as the runtime,time of release,how to penetrate the market when it comes to production of quality movies.
